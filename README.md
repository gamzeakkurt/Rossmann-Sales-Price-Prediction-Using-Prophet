In this project, we used Kaggle's 'Rossmann Store Sales data. You can reach all information about the data on Kaggle. 

Before using the project, you need to import Prophet and Plotly libraries from a command shell. 


For Prophet library :

```
py -m pip install prophet 

```
For Plotly library :

```
py -m pip install plotly 

```

If everything installs successfully, you can compile the project.

The project includes preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and forecasting. Forecasting is just only 6 weeks for 1 store. Forecasting includes  Both holidays and non-holidays. All visualization and prediction were interpreted by me. All information is also available in Jupyter Notebook.
